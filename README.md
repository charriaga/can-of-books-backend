## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log

## What can books do?

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

## Use this template

Clone this repo to your own account with the green "Use this template" button. Then, add any collaborators. Now you are ready to start adding features! Deploy your site to let the world know which books have had the greatest impact on you, and what's recommended. Enjoy!

## Collaboration

### Logistical

- What hours will you be available to communicate?

Charlie: 7am - 7pm
Armando: 9am - 9pm

- What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

Slack, Remo

- How often will you take breaks?

As needed, ideally 1 every 2 hours.

- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

Get TA help, contact JB, expand our hours.

### Cooperative

Make a list of each parson’s strengths.

**Armando:** Perserverence and adaptability

**Charlie:** Problem solving and server side knowledge

How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

See the project through the end, utlize resources, pair programming

In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?

**Armando:** Develop coding skills on both front-end and back-end

**Charlie:** Communication and developing understanding of code

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?

Make sure we have equal time as driver and navigator, meetiing up in remo and working together

### Conflict Resolution

What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

We will double down on making sure we have equal commits and driver navigator time.

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?

Communicate, double down on making sure we have equal commits and driver navigator time.

How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

We will approach it as a learning opportunity and help teach each other what we don't know and emphasize communication.
